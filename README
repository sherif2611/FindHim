The project is a system for locating missing individuals from their families. When you enter the website, the first thing you see is a list of all the individuals who are missing from their families and are currently on the website.

You can search for a specific person using various criteria such as their name, age, the country they disappeared in, the date of their disappearance, and whether they are male or female. You don't have to search with all these criteria at once; you can search with just one or more of them.

Once you find a person you are looking for, you can click on their profile to view complete information about them, including their photo and details about the person who found them.

If you are someone who has found a missing person, you can upload their photo and information, along with the location where they were found. You can do this by logging into the website after creating an account with your email.

Additionally, you can add missing individuals to the system, and you have the option to remove them at any time in the future.
